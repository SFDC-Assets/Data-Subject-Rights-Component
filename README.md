![DSAR Manager Compressed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7586106/100683126-8baed300-332c-11eb-8dc7-e5b5d13d8485.gif)

### Pre Requisites

This app requires a demo org with Privacy Center and Portability Policies enabled. The TA and Security Architect teams are working to make these available in the DXDO in the upcoming weeks. In the meanwhile you can use the License Editor within Blacktab to assign a **PrivacyCenter** add-on license to your demo org.

### Installation Instructions

### Option 1
Install the unlocked package in your org by accessing the following URL -
https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t4x000000cY5bAAE
**NOTE** The package requires Privacy Center to be enabled in your org. The package installation will fail if Privacy Center and the Portability Policy feature is not available in the org.

### Option 2
Clone the GitHub repository and deploy to a demo org or scratch org with Privacy Center enabled.
**NOTE** - There is no Feature setting for enabling Privacy Center in scratch orgs. Use the [Org Shape feature](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_shape_intro.htm) to create a scratch org based on an org that has Privacy Center enabled.

### Post Installation Instructions

1. Navigate to Setup and update the **Salesforce_Instance** Remote Site Setting to your demo org‚Äôs my domain URL.
2. Assign the **DSAR Perm Set** to required users.
3. Create a Portability Policy if one doesn‚Äôt exist.
4. You are all set.

### Usage Instructions

1. Click on App Launcher and access the DSAR Manager App.
2. Select a Portability Policy.

4. Search for and select the record against which you want to execute the Portability Policy.
5. Click **Send** .
6. A new record is added to the Data Subject Access Request List.

8. Give it a few seconds and click on the üîÅ button next to the record.
9. If successful, the Status of the request will update to **Complete** and the **Policy File URL** will become available.
